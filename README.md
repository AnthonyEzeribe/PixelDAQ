Welcome to the University of Sheffield Pixel DAQ directory. 

Currently there is a PixelReadout class. This holds functions to run the CAEN 1710 DAQ. To start the DAQ you have to create a PixelReadoutClass. This will initialise the DAQ and set the the trigger thresholds. 

The DAQDriver module runs the DAQ. After using the make file to create the exectutables you can find the exectutable to run the code in /home/argonshef/CAENDAQ/PixelDAQ/bin/x86_64/Release/DAQDriver.bin
